## Techniques
+ Splitting training data
	+ Holdout set? 70/30 split? 
	+ 10-fold CV?  
	+ Compare results of some train splits to loss on actual test set?

## Models to try (all regression methods)
[x]    Linear model, all predictors  
[ ]    Linear model, best subset  
[ ]    Linear model, ridge regularization  
[ ]    Linear model, lasso regularization  
[ ]    KNN  
[ ]		PCR  
[ ]    Polynomial model  
[ ]    Smoothing spline  
[ ]    Natural spline  
[ ]		GAM  
[ ]		Regression tree  
[ ]		Bagging/boosting/random forest
